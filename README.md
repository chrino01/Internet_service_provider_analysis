# ISP Provider Churn Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer churn for an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to uncover key factors that contribute to customer attrition and to support targeted retention strategies. The goal of this analysis is to understand patterns in customer behavior, identify the primary reasons for churn, and offer data-driven insights that help reduce turnover and enhance customer loyalty.

## Project Objectives
Identify Churn Drivers: Analyze demographics, service usage, contract details, and customer feedback to pinpoint factors associated with higher churn rates.
Support Retention Efforts: Provide actionable insights to guide the ISP in implementing effective retention initiatives, improving service, and engaging high-risk customers.

## Key Analysis Steps
### Data Exploration & Cleaning: Conduct initial exploration and preprocessing of the dataset, addressing any missing values, outliers, and quality issues.
### Feature Engineering: Create additional features related to churn, such as contract type, service usage, and payment history, to enrich the analysis.
### Churn Analysis: Use visualizations and statistical analysis to identify correlations and patterns in the data that are associated with customer churn.
### Insights & Recommendations: Based on the analysis, provide practical recommendations to help the ISP focus on areas that can improve customer satisfaction and retention.

## Project Outcomes
### Churn Drivers: Identify the primary factors driving customer churn, such as contract length, customer tenure, service-related issues, and payment methods.
### Strategic Recommendations: Offer specific recommendations, like flexible contract options, targeted promotions, and improved service reliability, to address high-risk customer segments.
Technologies Used
### Python: Data manipulation, preprocessing, and analysis.
### Pandas & Numpy: Data cleaning and feature engineering.
### Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualization tools for identifying trends, patterns, and insights.

This analysis provides a foundation for ISP providers to better understand customer needs, address potential issues proactively, and support long-term customer retention strategies.
